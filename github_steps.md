# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub. 
1. After creating and initializing a new GitHub repository, add the following 3 commands:
`git remote add origin [SSH key]` tells the local repos to set the remote repos to this address
`git branch -M main`
`git push -u origin main` sends the current version of the project up to the remote repos, and sets the main branch as the default branch to send work up to
Refresh your GitHub browswer tab and you should now see your repository.
